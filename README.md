# Project-Tile

prototype of a puzzle game.

Fixed sequence of 100 colored blocks are set for each stage.
You can drag and place any number of blocks as you want.
Blocks will fall if there is space below.
Each block has a different score depending on how many you place them at one time.
Blocks with more than 3 adjacent blocks of the same color are destroyed.

If you are unable to place at least 3 blocks, the game is over.
If you successfully place all 100 blocks your score will be recorded.

Try to get the highest score.
